The Towers of Hanoi is a classic puzzle that involves three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes. The goal is to move all the disks from the source peg to the target peg while following these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller disk.
3. Temporary storage (auxiliary peg) can be used as needed.

The algorithm to solve the Towers of Hanoi problem is implemented using recursion. Here's a high-level explanation of the logic:

1. If there is only one disk (base case), move it directly from the source peg to the target peg.
2. If there are more than one disk (recursive case):
   a. Move n-1 disks from the source peg to the auxiliary peg, using the target peg as temporary storage.
   b. Move the largest disk (nth disk) from the source peg to the target peg.
   c. Move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary peg to the target peg, using the source peg as temporary storage.

By following these steps recursively, you can solve the Towers of Hanoi puzzle for any number of disks.

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of the Towers of Hanoi algorithm is O(2^n), where n is the number of disks. This is because for each additional disk, the number of moves required approximately doubles. It's an exponential time complexity, which means it can become very slow for a large number of disks.

**Space Complexity:**
The space complexity of the algorithm is O(n) due to the recursion stack. In the worst case, the maximum depth of the recursion is n, as you're making recursive calls for n-1 disks.

In practice, the Towers of Hanoi problem is used more as a demonstration of recursion and algorithmic thinking rather than for solving real-world problems due to its exponential time complexity for larger n.
